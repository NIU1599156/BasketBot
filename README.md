# Basket-Bot
## Description
This robot will consist of a rotating base with an incorporated camera and arm.
First of all, the robot will rotate and take pictures with the camera, and using computer vision, it will process these images to identify the object where it needs to shoot the ping pong ball and know its position. Then, the arm will pick up a ping pong ball and make the necessary calculations to determine the trajectory and power with which it should launch the ball so that it can score in the target. The position of the target can be changed within a certain range, and the robot must be able to detect it and score the ball regardless.
